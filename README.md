# Herb-Classification

This uses fastai's vision package to build a very basic model for classifying images of herbs.

The images were downloaded from bing using the search API

They are then cleaned using fastai's functions

Classification done using a resnet 18 model

These are then deployed to a simple app using fastai's widgets
